# Cointegrated Indices

## Project Motivation 


## Project Goal
The goal of the following project was to determine if the volatility indices EVZ and VXEEM are cointegrated. Cointegration refers to a correlation between time series in the long term. If these series are in fact correlated then it's possible that a pair trading strategy could be used to create abnormal returns.
